- Autoplay, pull down to refresh, and algorithmically optimized recommendations and feeds have pulled people deeper and deeper into their phone than ever. Screen time is the highest it’s ever been in human history. 
- People are not only becoming more and more conscious of these devices but are growing increasingly fed up with the purging of their time. Rightfully so.
- The existence and success of apps like opal, one sec, freedom, screen time and products like the light phone are proof
- But it still remains that people use social media, despite knowing the considerable downside/effects. 
- I chalk this up to human’s need to connect. And I think it goes like this “I want to check instagram (to see what my friends and people I care enough about are doing). Oh cool megan’s engaged. Comment “congratz megan!”. Keep scrolling, eilleen gu is on the cover of vogue. “What can’t she do.” I wonder who she’s dating these days anyway. Tap. Tap. Stare. Tap. Stare. Back. Keep scrolling. Ad. Keep scrolling. Ad.” 30 min have gone by. And this person feels nothing. They maybe even feel worse. 
- Creators on the other hand face this problem of visibility on the things they create. “ how can I get anyone to listen to my music without the help of social media. ?” “I saw this effective content strategy my friend used to get people to buy her  handmade purses” “maybe I’ll do something similar for my music.”
- The result of this is more of both creators audiences respectively spending time on the platform. The better a creator gets at making content the more effective they are at keeping people glued to their screen.
- But what if we removed the middle man? What if every creator had their own personal feed, free of the harmful retention devices or information scalping?
- I built jacobs.blue based off these premises exactly. At the very basic level I don’t want to harm the people that like my stuff. Or anyone for that matter. 
- But a problem still exists even if everyone had their own feed. What good does a bunch of islands with no knowledge of each other do for anyone? A connective tissue between  all personal feeds is the key to a world free of addictive social media usage.
- It’s not to say screen time is bad, just that screen time not freely given is bad.
- Feeds should be connected by us, real people. We all have a real way we connect and share ideas with one another. What if we could capture that interactivity for others to use as a paper trail? 
- We are all makers. We are all consumers. We are all connected. This is not the future of the world. Not even the future of the internet but it is the next chapter in personal knowledge management, sharing our work, and online community.


Check out feeds here. Our best attempt.
