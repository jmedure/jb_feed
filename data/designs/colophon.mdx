Like myself, Jacobs.Blue is a constant work in progress.

In hopes to carve out my own representative corner of the internet. Overt two years ago I set out to build this thing.

I hoped to create a space...

- where I could make anything and quickly share it.
- that was a fluid enough to support any creative format yet robust enough for a person to intuitively navigate.
- that was to my UX preferences and experiments.
- that not only considers a user's time and privacy but actively takes an anti-predatory stance towards both ends.

## How to

Jacobs.blue was designed primarily as an [anti-feed](https://jacobs.blue/design/anti-feed)

### Project status taxonomy

Yet another work in progress biased towards action...

## Next

Jacobs.Blue evolves as I do.

## Inspirations

I would be remissed if I didn't mention all the exceptional designers sharing their work that helped shaped this project. Ranging from small to very large sources of inspiration, Jacobs.Blue would not exist in it's current from without the following.
