Like myself, Jacobs.Blue is a constant work in progress.

In hopes to carve out my own representative corner of the internet. Overt two years ago I set out to build this thing.

I hoped to create a space...

- where I could make anything and quickly share it.
- that was a fluid enough to support any creative format yet robust enough for a person to intuitively navigate.
- that was to my UX preferences and experiments.
- that not only considers a user's time and privacy but actively takes an anti-predatory stance towards both ends.

## How to

Jacobs.blue was designed primarily as an [anti-feed](https://jacobs.blue/design/anti-feed)

### Project status taxonomy

## Next

Jacobs.Blue evolves as I do.
