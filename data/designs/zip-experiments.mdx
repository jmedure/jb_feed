I've worked full-time at [Zip](https://zip.co) since Novemeber, 2021. During that time I've lead design for all "shopping" experiences within the Zip ecosystem.

This translates to my being responsible for all flows a user may interact with on their journey to complete a purchase. This includes onboarding, browsing, paying, then paying again. As far as touchpoints, I spend the vast majority of my time in the mobile iOS app but my work touches our website, browser extension, and checkout integration as well.

This page stands a running and often updated log of the many tests, experiments, and net-new features I've shipped in the last two years. I'll go into some further context for those interested but feel free to skip ahead to the work.

**Our Zip team**

Zip's design team is small and scrappy. The 5 of us cover our entire US product ecosystem.

In practice we aim to be embedded on different agile squads that work on various parts of our product ecosystem. However, given the size of our team we often jump in and out of other squads in order to deliver work.

**Understanding the Zip user**

At Zip, we have several tools to help us understand our users. We often leverage [UserTesting.com](https://UserTesting.com) to regularly run both moderated and un-moderated remote users tests, we use [Fullstory](https://fullstory.com) to view active user sessions, and we use [Amplitude](https://Amplitude.com) to run A/B tests. Additionally, we have a general research team that runs in-person deep-dives.

The effects of these tools are greater than anticipated. Not only do they help us form a clear picture of our user, these tools help validate our team's design decisions internally.

<ComingSoon />
