If I acknowledge that working on music everyday and treating my work like
a professional is the better route over the long run I run into days where
music isn't fun and I forget why I started in the first place. Great work
seems to come from a mystical place within myself and for me to stay in
touch with that I need to sometimes be reminded why i started in the first
place. I need to be reminded to have fun with it and to encourage
curiosity and joy and love.

I want to craft everything with love and it
can be difficult to muster on a daily baiss. I'm feeling this struggle.
Part of this mix is absolving pressures I put on myself and not tkaing it
seriously and part of it is taking it so seriously that I would treat it
like a job. What's the solution here? Tinker with the process? I don't
have to be anything at all. I can quit music tomorrow and that will be
okay.
