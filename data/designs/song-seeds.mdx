Finishing the ideas we start is _hard_.

Sometimes starting the ideas we intend to finish is _even harder_. But why?

Despite more access and a lower barrier to entry than ever we still encounter:

- internal and external pressures
- seemingly unlimited options in the form of plug-ins, FX and instruments
- alignment with collaborators.

But what if we could lower the stakes, pick a direction, and build momentum towards finishing our ideas? What if it was as simple as drawing a card from from a deck you could take anywhere?
