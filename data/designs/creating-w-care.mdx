Up until this point I had never used themes on a site. So when I was starting my [latest idea](https://createwcare.com) I wanted to take the opportunity to not only use light and dark modes but inlist multiple themes.

Since the entire site is static this wasn't going to be too hard. Thanks to Paco Coursey's [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) it was even easier than expected.

Beyond following Paco's basic implementation guide I defined my additional themes in css and built a button that increments through the themes using some basic js.

```css:global.css
:root {
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
}

[data-theme='dark'] {
  background-color: #121212;
  color: white;
}

[data-theme='orange'] {
  background-color: #ff630c;
  color: #fdff99;
}

[data-theme='red'] {
  background-color: #d21c1c;
  color: #edffcf;
}

[data-theme='blue'] {
  background-color: #1c4fd2;
  color: #ccff00;
}

[data-theme='green'] {
  background-color: #1f2b14;
  color: #ccff00;
}

[data-theme='purple'] {
  background-color: #22216c;
  color: #ff630c;
}

[data-theme='brown'] {
  background-color: #a8e5ff;
  color: #402f2b;
}
```

I listed each theme in a small array, then used the button to increment through the array and set the theme to the next theme in the array.

```jsx:ThemeChanger.jsx
<button
  className="p-4 sm:p-3 rounded-full bg-white/05 backdrop-invert brightness-150"
  id="change"
  value={theme}
  onClick={(e) => {
    const index = themes.indexOf(theme);
    const next = themes[(index + 1) % themes.length];
    setTheme(next);
    console.log(next);
  }}
></button>;
```

## Taking it a bit further

At this point I was stoked but in order to take it up a notch the idea came to me to set the favicon to the corresponding theme color each time the theme for the site changed. I had seen transitioning favicons done before but never looked under the hood to undertstand how it works and I'd never seen it done with so many themes.

Upon initial research I found [this article](https://dev.to/eddysims/create-a-themed-favicon-for-color-modes-2ok1) by Eddie Sims. Although I didn't use any of his work it was helpful for my initial approach.

Full disclosure I have no idea how good or bad this from a "what you're supposed to do" perspective but it does work as intended.

First I had to make and export each respective favicon and make sure it matched semantically with the themes in the themes array.

From there I just used the <code className="flex-row items-center bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-700 text-sm rounded-lg px-1">theme</code> object to as part of the favicon soure, so that each time the site theme chnaged, the favicon name also changes.

```jsx:ThemeChanger.jsx
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>CREATE WITH CARE</title>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
        <meta property="og:title" content="Create with Care" key="title" />
        <link rel="icon" href={`/favicon-${theme}-32.png`} />
      </Head>
      <button
        className="p-4 sm:p-3 rounded-full bg-white/05 backdrop-invert brightness-150"
        id="change"
        value={theme}
        onClick={(e) => {
          const index = themes.indexOf(theme);
          const next = themes[(index + 1) % themes.length];
          setTheme(next);
          console.log(next);
        }}
      ></button>
    </>
  );
```
