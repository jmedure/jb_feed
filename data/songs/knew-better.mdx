# Lyrics

Verse 1:  
No, It don't matter cuz it's over  
I ripped all of your pictures and your posters  
Off every single wall looking for closure  
Don't think I'm over it  
Prolly' find a bitch like you  
So she won't stab in the motherfuckin side, you  
Make everything about you it's so hard to  
Not feel anything

Pre-Chorus:  
Well I can't be the one to love you, babe  
I gave you everything until you fucking left  
I hope you're happier than me these days  
'Cause I feel so fucking numb  
Bitch I don't got nothing left!

Hook:  
And no it's not fair!  
That you're not here!  
I knew better!  
Then to give my heart away!  
And no it's not fair!  
That you're not here!  
All in my head  
'Cause I loved someone!

Verse 2:  
Listen, how'd you do it babe?  
How'd you throw us all away?  
I don't get it  
Did you see the story  
We was writing down on notebooks full of pages left to turn?  
So out of touch these days  
Busy running from the same situation  
Mean it's hard enough to say  
Doesn't mean I don't feel you still  
Didn't you see my face?  
I don't believe you, doll  
Now I cannot believe at all

Pre-Chorus:  
Well I can't be the one to love you, babe  
I gave you everything until you fucking left  
I hope you're happier than me these days  
'Cause I feel so fucking numb  
Bitch I don't got nothing left!

Hook:  
And no it's not fair!  
That you're not here!  
I knew better!  
Then to give my heart away!  
And no it's not fair!  
That you're not here!  
All in my head  
'Cause I loved someone!
