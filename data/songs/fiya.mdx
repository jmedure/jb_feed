# Lyrics

Listen  
Yeah

Verse 1:  
We were dirty dancing  
Our shadows ran around the kitchen floor  
Told you beauty's only on surface  
This is so much more  
I need your touch  
Your lust, your trust  
Your skin, your sin  
Baby fall inline

Hook:  
I need your FIRE!  
Hey yeah  
Give me FIRE!  
Hey yeah  
I need your FIRE!  
Hey yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah

Verse 2:  
It's a toss-up in the sheets, I still find myself  
Your legs on my teeth, I need all your health  
When it comes down to the line, prolly save my self  
And I saved myself  
Yeah  
And I'm back in the same bed alone  
The same place don't feel quite as warm  
The same voice yelling pick up my phone  
He knows that we're better off  
But still I call

Hook 2:  
I need your FIRE!  
Hey yeah  
Give me FIRE!  
Hey Yeah  
I need your FIRE!  
Baby  
Yeah Oh  
I need your FIRE!  
Baby  
Give me FIRE!  
Baby  
I need your FIRE!  
Baby  
Yeah Yeah Yah

Verse 3:  
I write down the times in my head I feel fine  
Some things don't make sense, I think that's alright  
I still love the sunset it's always on my mind  
On my mind  
Just like you shawty  
Out in the summertime, yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah

Call me and I'll keep you lit
