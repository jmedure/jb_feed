# Lyrics

Baby I    
Think too much sometimes   
Lay me down    
And make me holy    
I care too much   
Something’s got me down   
But maybe I’ll   
Take it slowly   
 
My fears unfolding   
My weakness growing   
These walls keep closing   
But eyes stay [open]   

Maybe I need to whip the foreign   
Maybe I’m built for something more and   
I don’t know where my life is going   
What if I die tomorrow night   
Maybe I   

Maybe its me I’m reaching for and   
Maybe there’s peace in what’s before me   
Maybe my feet keep moving forward   
Just need a moment   

Oh   
Baby I    
Think too much sometimes   
Lay me down   
And make me holy   
I care too much    
Something’s got me down   
But maybe I’ll   
Take it slowly
