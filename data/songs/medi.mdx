# Lyrics

Hook:  
You're all I think about girl  
You make me fucking strong yeah yeah  
Before the sun goes down  
Give me all your love  
You're all I think about girl  
You make me fucking strong yeah yeah  
Before the sun goes down  
Give me all your love

Verse 1:  
Slide through the city with braces on  
Who give a fuck baby if you take too long  
We don't even gotta go we could shake some  
I mean  
(I'm just glad I gotchu in this place)  
Sad muhfuckas probably hate this song  
They ainâ€™t seen the way we moving with the safety off  
And they ain't seen you pull the trigger in that lacy thong  
I mean  
(I'm just glad I found you anyway)  
Stay with me babe  
I wanna make you my lover  
I need to say it for myself if not for you  
Yeah yeah

Hook:  
You're all I think about girl  
You make me fucking strong yeah yeah  
Before the sun goes down  
Give me all your love  
You're all I think about girl  
You make me fucking strong yeah yeah  
Before the sun goes down  
Give me all your love

Bridge:  
Baby  
I'm so fucking scared  
Or maybe I'm just not prepared  
'Cause when I look at you, you look like a movie  
Now I all I wanna do is be better for you my love

Hook:  
You're all I think about girl  
You make me fucking strong yeah yeah  
Before the sun goes down  
Give me all your love  
You're all I think about girl  
You make me fucking strong yeah yeah  
Before the sun goes down  
Give me all your love

Outro(Unconditional):  
Unconditional  
Yeah, I love the way you fuck me even more than that, I love your truth  
All it took was two nights for I knew I'd fall for you  
And I fell for you  
Baby when you layed your head on my chest  
Love the way you make the move  
Cuz I swear with you now baby I'm untouchable  
And if you really want the sky don't whisper darling  
I will grab the moon  
And I'll hold for you  
Everything you got on your mind  
It's unconditional, love
