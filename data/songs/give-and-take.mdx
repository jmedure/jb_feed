# Lyrics

Don't stray too far away  
I'm unhappy with the space  
Just know that our love is safe  
I know we been playing games

But that shit just not for show  
I'm in love with every throw  
You kiss me I bite the throat  
We're selfish and that's for sure

I'm falling  
Falling babe  
I'm in love with  
Everything  
You give to me  
All that you give to me  
(In love with all that you give me babe)

I'm calling  
Calling babe  
I'm in love with  
Everything  
You keep from me  
All that you keep from Medure

We spent so many days  
Chasing the time away  
I'm never afraid  
To say  
I still believe in you  
Cuz I still believe in you

And your such a pretty face  
I'm all over places  
We navigate to  
You still feel brand new  
You still feel brand new

I'm falling  
Falling babe  
I'm in love with  
Everything  
You give to me  
All that you give to me  
(In love with all that you give me babe)

I'm calling  
Calling babe  
I'm in love with  
Everything  
You keep from me  
All that you keep from Medure
