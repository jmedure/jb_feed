# Lyrics

Verse 1:  
Am I to blame?  
For holding you up without no plan to fall  
I'll take your pain  
I'm sorry  
I'm lost  
I need you right beside me  
At most, we barely got to climb it  
Great heights when I'm in touch with you

Hook:  
I'm down every hill till I'm home  
I spend my time thinking bout' you  
Down to stay right here, just to keep you warm  
To fast for me to catch ya, headed  
Down the hill and I'm not alone  
I'm mean I'm down the hill just to see you go  
But baby please don't

Verse 2:  
Save your discussion  
These problems started from trust and  
Your mouth is telling me one thing  
Your heart is telling me something else  
Still live in Flushing  
When I'm just tryna be something  
I spill my guts on percussion and worry about my fucking self  
About my fucking self  
About my fucking [BLEEP]
