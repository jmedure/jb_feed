# Lyrics

Hook:  
Ooooh Yeah  
Ooooh Yeah Hey  
Ooooh Yeah  
Ooooh Yeah Hey

Verse:  
Besides  
The fact you're everywhere I go  
And I'm always on the go  
Mama worried I don't sleep right  
I'm either working on the code  
Or I miss you in my bones  
Play that muhfucker each night  
I mean another song I wrote about you  
Where I blame myself again  
I can't pretend  
I'm not losing you and losing it  
But you're right here

At least for right now  
I didn't want to walk away, did you?  
Oooh Yeah eh Yeah AH!  
I didn't want to walk away, did you?  
Oh Yeah
