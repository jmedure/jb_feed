# Lyrics

Verse 1:  
Two yellow birds sing  
A song about you and I  
Know every single word  
Yeah Yeah  
Two yellow birds sing  
A song about her and it's  
The sweetest thing I've heard  
Yeah  
I took the long way back  
I guess I'll go home empty  
Never mind if it's all I had  
Somehow it's still not enough  
She need her space right now  
But I don't know what that means  
Gravity, cause then it all came down  
[Our] Song sound different now

Hook 1:
Said she don't love me no more  
She don't love me no more  
No she don't love me no more  
My heart on the floor  
I slam all the doors  
Yeah  
No she don't love me no more  
She don't love me no more  
She don't love me no more  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Verse 2:  
Every day is so different now  
I've been on my own  
Picking up pieces of memories that still tell me she's here  
Yeah  
But it's all in my head again  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah  
I hear her dance down the stairs every now and again  
They say I'm colder to touch even though my house is in flames  
I don't feel no pain  
She's dirt on my grave  
I'm sayin  
It don't matter cause I'm dying

Hook 2:  
She don't love me no more  
Said she don't love me no more  
She don't love me no more  
Heart on the floor  
I slam all the doors  
Yeah  
Said she don't love me no more  
She don't love me no more  
She don't love me no more  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Outro (Tomorrow):  
Well don't you know the sun comes tomorrow?  
And I've been focused on getting better every day  
Mama said the sun comes tomorrow  
Life ain't always perfect and that's okay

I don't know where I'm going  
But I know I'm not the only one  
I guess we'll know when we get there  
Look at all that I've done  
She don't have to love me anyway  
That's just another story I told myself  
To hide all my pride, with no intent  
No don't say it, no

Don't you know the sun comes tomorrow?  
And I've been focused on getting better every day  
Mama said the sun comes tomorrow  
Life ain't always perfect and that's okay
