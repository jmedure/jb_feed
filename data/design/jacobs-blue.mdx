{/* I don't like having my attention constantly vied for. I don't like the idea of making art with a playlist in mind. I don't like the idea of more of my time being taken from me then intended. */}

There are many reasons I do not like being an active user of social media.

{/* The most preverse being the algorithmic incentive structures that fuel these platforms create bad incentives for art. */}

Regardless of my opinion, for any artist trying to share their art the effectiveness of social media as a distribution vehicle is undeniable.
So undeniable, that several current major label employees have called me crazy for suggesting there is a path to a maker's commerical success that doesn't involve social media.

{/* But if I dislike being a social media user why should I subject the people that want to listen to my music to the same pain points I feel? --- */}

Thus, a problem.

- I'm a maker that lives to make things and share them with the world.
- I'm not ethically aligned with the use of social media.
- Social media is the best tool for sharing things

To combat this problem I built [jacobs.blue](https://jacobs.blue)

Jacobs.blue provides a home for everything I ever make and a way to easily consume as much as someone may want but no more than they want. There are no other actors vying for site visitors attention. That means you come to jacobs.blue and leave when you want. no longer looking up from your phone 30 min later to realize you've lost 30 mins of your life.

The only incentive structure that exists is chronoligicality. Meaning whatever was made last is prioritized, not what "performs" the best.

There _is_ a real need for site notifications which I'm poorly meeting through my subscribe form in my footer. But ideally, I have some sort of notification system that's easily manageable from a user perspective, where users get the notifications they want.

W/o social media I have a discoverability problem but that just forces me to make more meaningful connections directly, whether online or in-person. Once a connection is made, jacobs.blue is where I can send people to dive into my work.

The UX intentionally rewards the explorer. This is a behavior I want to champion over the typical kite-lite social media users (myself included) that blows whichever way the wind blows them, or buys whatever ad is thrown in front of them.

## Design process

I started work on jacobs.blue in 2020 and did not launch it until 2022. It went through several iterations in figma before developing. Speaking of which, this project wouldn't exist with out my friend Will he built the initial "backend" framework for Jacobs.blue, on which the site still runs today. This site was an enormous development undertaking for me which also contributed to the long production timeline. It's been fun to learn along the way though lol.

This is soooo corny hahah but it's true. Making this site has made me more comfortable being all the things I am under one umbrella. Social media has made me feel like I'm <i>only</i> a musician, but in the real world I am many things. Jacobs.blue is not only a good representation of this but helped me own it.
