    <p className="font-light text-neutral-900">
      At times I need to be reminded why I started making music in the first
      place in order to re-route my creativity through the lenses of curiosity,
      joy and love, the most powerful creative forces.
    </p>
    <p className="font-light text-neutral-900">
      If I acknowledge that working on music everyday and treating my work like
      a professional is the better route over the long run I run into days where
      music isn't fun and I forget why I started in the first place. Great work
      seems to come from a mystical place within myself and for me to stay in
      touch with that I need to sometimes be reminded why i started in the first
      place. I need to be reminded to have fun with it and to encourage
      curiosity and joy and love. I want to craft everything with love and it
      can be difficult to muster on a daily baiss. I'm feeling this struggle.
      Part of this mix is absolving pressures I put on myself and not tkaing it
      seriously and part of it is taking it so seriously that I would treat it
      like a job. What's the solution here? Tinker with the process? I don't
      have to be anything at all. I can quit music tomorrow and that will be
      okay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or this really just about the fact that I should be able to let it go. The
      fact that I can't is the problem?
