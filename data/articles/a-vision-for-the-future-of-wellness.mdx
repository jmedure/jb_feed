I was walking through the Denver Airport recently on my way back to Brooklyn and couldn’t help but notice how many people were overweight. It was astonishing to me that roughly 50% of the people I encountered were some form of [obese](https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity#tab=tab_1). Roughly half of those people were [extremely obese](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/losing-weight/extreme-obesity-and-what-you-can-do).

I can’t think of a better representative sample of the US population than an airport. If half of my encounters were with people that were overweight, we have some serious issues on our hands. Before writing this I would have said that this problem is out of sight out of mind while living in New York City and I needed the experience of the airport to open my eyes to this problem. But I didn’t know that more than half of adult New Yorkers have overweight (34%) or obesity (22%) body fat.[source](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/obesity.page#:~:text=In%20New%20York%20City%2C%20obesity,%25%20or%20obesity%20(22%25)) If New York City is an epidemic then we have a a national health crisis on our hands.

Obviously, I cannot solve this single handedly. However, I’d like to at least make an attempt at helping. I’m treating this living document as a framework through which I might make that attempt.

I want to have a think on why we might have arrived here.

Initial, more-obvious but non-exhaustive thoughts:

- We have an evolved monkey brain that seeks short term pleasure over long term well being
- Advertisers Preying on that monkey brain - “eat this!”, processed foods etc
- Lack of education (this is actually complex)
    - Competing information
        - Diet fads
        - Different thought leaders optimizing for different end-goals then sharing as an end-all-be-all (think dietitian vs nutritionist vs longevity scholar vs lean-bulk bro-science all trying to sell you their truth)
    - Being taught harmful things and/or not being taught anything; -1 and 0 respectively
        - Cultural/Rearing Harmful influence
    - Not being taught the fundamental in this equation, which is seeking growth, experimenting for my body
- Socio economic disparity
    - Healthy food can be expensive, or can seem expensive.
        - (Local fresh ingredients actually can be very affordable at say a Farmers Market or CSA - it’s less convenient than the grocery store in both of these instances)
    - Poorer school system reflects poorer health education
        - (This may not always be true but is probably correlated at some level. I think all primary education lacks in this area.)
            - Primary shortcoming is teaching an exact science that could be non helpful for a celiac for example instead of teaching frameworks to discover what works for the individual through trial and error.

There is work to be done here around how and why overweight people become and stay overweight. I think this can only be understood through deep discovery of the people experiencing this and they’re stories. Food, like money is emotional for many.

- I think I could get here by interviewing with/living with some overweight people. My hunch is that there are transcendent habits, food psychologies, and deeply ingrained emotional relationships with food that don’t serve these people.

On this topic I feel like the effects of obesity on our culture are perverse as well. We hold a loose collective idea of what a fit person is in our mind. This is at least slightly different for everyone. But having so many extremely overweight people drives that benchmark up to a higher bmi. For example, I have a hunch that 20% body fat 40 years ago seemed unfit where as today the same person might still think of themselves as fit because of this “Benchmark creep”.

![Untitled](A%20vision%20for%20the%20future%20of%20wellnekss%20f223941a73dd430683c1602b9f18016b/Untitled.png)

One thing I think is safe to assume for now is a lack of growth mindset. I doubt that many overweight people are doing the due diligence required for a healthy lifestyle. The truth is 1) there *is* so much competing information on health and wellness 2) every genetic makeup has different adjustments to make in order to seek better health (this relates more to diet than exercise.) 3) the only way to really understand what is working for you is through tracking your results over time and measuring those results against your goals. This is a ton of work.

How does one impart this willingness to sift through all this information, seek truth through their own personal science, and then track and maintain this information over time, not to mention actually do the work of cooking, eating, and training correctly?

In short, I think it’s a massive task.

Continuing on this…there are actually a ton of government funded resources out there pertaining to health. Have you been on a government funded nutrition website recently? Information *is* available but feels dated and difficult to access. I had to download a PDF from 2005 to get information on reducing cholesterol without taking blood thinners.

![Untitled](A%20vision%20for%20the%20future%20of%20wellness%20f223941a73dd430683c1602b9f18016b/Untitled%201.png)

This information was published in 2005 and I’m not qualified to disprove anything in it. All I’m saying is I think there is a ton of opportunity to do better with information dissemination. You’re telling me I need to learn do all this work to understand my health and then it’s not going to be easy for me to grasp myself. I’ll have to read a book? There’s opportunity here for us to better meet people where they’re at.

— Other then resulting in a poor lifestyle people are literally dying to being unhealthy more then anything else

![Untitled](A%20vision%20for%20the%20future%20of%20wellness%20f223941a73dd430683c1602b9f18016b/Untitled%203.png)

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm)

— This was a general intro to working towards solving a public health crisis.

Beyond this there is maybe a wrong approach being taken at gyms currently. This may be a naivety in myself to think it possible, however, I have trained at various gyms for 10 years and have grasped little ideology onboarding. Gyms are available and then I can see where someone that knows nothing about the gym to be metaphorically dropped off a cliff upon signup. That means even if a person in poor health decides to make a change with their life and signup for a gym they are met with a bewildering and vast world that can be intimidating. Not to mention, there are many existing reference points for what good health looks like and many of them are strictly aesthetic. Without monitoring people’s organs we actually have no idea how *healthy* they are. The gym is also a place that emphasizes pre-existing insecurities creating giga-chads and carrot-ladies. Without verified guidance the gym which started as a healthy idea can end up being harmful.

## Plan

### Hypothesis:

The answer to helping others in this space is:

- Unpacking personal ideologies, psychology and cultural bias from -1 to 0 and then building from 0 to 1
    - IE unpacking all the wrong shit you’ve been taught then giving you frameworks to infinitely build on
- Mindset and framework coaching to approach one’s personal health journey
- Literal how-to education on diet, nutrition, movements, navigating mental health
- Straight-forward access to resources to deepen their knowledge
- Personal coaching both from hands on and afar to teach uplift and hold accountable (coaching is the North Star)
- Community encouragement
- Better more affordable access to supplementation and health screening/testing
- A footprint of documentation and traceability creating trust in the information they’re given

### Goal:

To help give people the best shot at living the longest, healthiest and happiest lives they can.

There is an element of practicality here that I don’t quite know how to incorporate. Like we want to provide as much reasonable access as we can. SO free for people that need it kinda vibe. Charge for people that can afford it. Make the aspects that are usually blocked by “health care” as accessible as we can make them (ie more affordable blood panel access

- this may mean we need to make our own versions or these offerings

A mind-set shift is the focal point btw that will scale much greater then any piece of equipment or testing.

### Answer:

A special gym

Things that make this gym special:

- **Tiered memberships** (*note: I’m not really concerned about these specifics yet but I’m imagining a place where the main members get the best of the best and they also sponsor other members that otherwise wouldn’t have access or are really in need. — think income disparity, think health disparity*)
    - Max membership comes w/
        - All below plus
        - Panels Paid for
    - Base membership comes w/
        - lightweight tracking capacity (eg member would receive whoop strap equivalent, heart rate monitor, scale, etc…)
        - Tailored Programs
        - Optional Diet Plans
    - Free Memberships
        - If you’re over a certain fat BMI and other benchmarks, gym use is completely free
    - Non-Members
        - Content Published Online
            - Studies
            - Instructional
            - Work-outs
- Pro bono Dev and UI updates to gov websites and resources
- Proprietary technology to more easily help users navigate personal health.
    - Ie blood results in the same place as information about results in the same place as tracking macros(if u want) same place as programmed workouts, maxes etc
- Gold standard equipment
- Gold standard supplementation
- Testing/ Lab
    - Blood panels
    - CGM - continuos glucose monitor
    - Eventually
        - DEXA
        - VO2max
        - Urologist + Sonogram
- Community
    - Events
    - Workouts
    - Runs?
    - Sports
    - Gardens
    - Volunteering

I imagine a place where a member is met wherever they’re at in their process. Pro -> Novice, Child -> Elderly. Healthy -> unhealthy. It’s a place where all of these people can come to learn and practice. The main device is a gym in a traditional sense with great equipment and lots of space for alternative types of movements. People can be expected to make serious life-style changes at this gym. This means we have to help them form a vision of good health. We will rely on gold-standard research to bolster this information as well as fund our own studies and further publications on health with the North Star being giving people the best shot at living the longest, healthiest and happiest lives they can.

Users would be issued a wearable device, receive regular(depending on test) testing (blood, weight, organs, fat, ability) and be made more conscious of their health. A core tenet of our gym might be *you can’t improve what you don’t track*. Each member would have a coach that was accountable to a limited number of members that was available for 1:1 coaching (potentially at an additional fee), group coaching and open business hour feedback. Each member would have someone to send video to to get feedback on from, ask questions, goal set, etc. Users would have a wholistic plan including workouts, diet, lifestyle to follow if they choose.

Users could be coached on anything from diet to sleep in order to coincide with their goals. I hope we attract the kind of person that may want to live a long good life and be able to pick up their grandkids at 75 w/o pain.

Physically the space would represent room for lounging, studying, exercise of many forms including traditional weightlifting, sports including martial arts and basketball, coaching rooms, testing rooms, a lab, offices,  outdoor space, a potential cafeteria and/or kitchen, a coffee shop, library, and whatever else may pertain to helping you form a wholistic vision of health. This is limited to controlling the things you can control.

It’s not clear what needs will materialize after further research. But the ideal vision is a place where a person who knows nothing to be onboarded into a healthy life and we have the majority of the tools to do bring that vision to life and maintain it through their focused effort.

I imagine the coaching will be integral to the success or failure of this model. Coaches have to be experts in their field and hopefully a couple of fields including nutrition, diet, mobility, physical therapy, weightlifting, strength training, endurance sports, mental models etc. Also they will need to be personable and compassionate people. They’ll need to be versed in all that we offer and can provide and be able to provide specific coaching for different types of members. I can see a version of this where we have coaches for specific things and clients maybe revolve around coaches learning as they go.

I believe the membership can be relatively expensive and can be enough to even offer people in poor health a free membership. I think it would be fun to do community events and give away scholarships to future members as well.

A defining ethos of the gym would be to continually learn and push oneself. Gym leaders including myself will not know everything nor suggest that they do. The culture will have to be one of

- Through experience we have a good idea of a baseline to shoot for
    - IE certain measures of mobility, diet, strength, endurance etc
- From there we won’t assume anything and will treat every member as an individual
- Through frameworks and history we will build entire plans to measure and increment around our members goals.
- Coaches will have all the know-how if they need to be leaned on and can act like counselors in order to give members what they want within these bounds.

Ideology will be a fundamental part of the culture here. Like hey the leading science says these things are great and these things are bad. We’re gonna do our best to adhere to those guidelines and not judge you if you fall short sometimes. For example we obviously know smoking is a bad thing for you health. We have to take a stand that says it’s bad for you. BUT we’re not gonna judge you for those decisions and we’re gonna to help you try to quit if you want to do so.

I think a part of this is carefully treading on living an enjoyable life too. And I’m just not never gonna eat sugar again and I don’t expect anyone else to either despite it’s negative consequences. But I want to at least teach you that we have evidence of that being bad for you and you can make your own decisions. But you own them and a fully aware of those consequences. With full adherence I think there would be a bit of self-righteousness being cultivated and I consider that a poison to the community aspects of this idea.

Funny enough community is one for the most important parts of this vision.

There is an intimidation factor that stops people from joining gyms. I want to do our best to dispel that.

## It starts with me

I have a large amount of insecurity around how little I really know in this space. I’m encouraged to try though because of the amount of competing beliefs around fitness. I do not want to ever be the subject matter expert on health. I think that many people do this specifically and well already. There is *too much* to know. Where I think I can truly provide value is in an approach that is starkly different from what people are used to. Leading a gym with fundamental frameworks instead of atmosphere or vibe or equipment. I imagine a world where I take all those things as a given. Have the best atmosphere and best equipment and a space where a vast array of types of training can be completed but it’s all lead from an ideological perspective. I don’t want to be the thought leader in a given field, I want to source experts and welcome their coaching.

To me this is a very similar ask to a DAW. And reminds me of the conversation will and I had about complex interfaces. Hard to onboard but more powerful and rewarding. We will have many people not get it. We will have many be frustrated with the fact that it doesn’t meet their pre-existing expectations. I’m okay with that. However, I can’t run a business with no product market fit so I’ll need to determine how we scale this concept. The results of which would determine if we had a policy where every member had to have a wearable and a coach vs if people were curious they could just come to our gym and get a workout in. The initial idea is like a no-day pass kinda vibe or no free-working out kinda vibe. If you wanted a day-pass we’d also take the time to a mini-onboarding /brief of what the expectation is at this place.

On a personal level I think I must do a lot of research and subject myself to a lot of the things I’m pointing to as a great approach to health. I need to dive deeper into this space and focus on the results. I think I would also get great benefit in seeking certifications as a personal trainer, etc. I have a lot to uncover with how people are currently being coached. As an average but avid gym goer I definitely don’t feel all my needs are met so this is why I’m suggesting there is so much room for opportunity.

## MVP —> Blue sky

Something that needs to stay top of mind is that people may not even want this so I think proving out the concept as much possible at each step is vital. TBH I sort of think it doesn’t scale extremely well and there are couple moments in this idea where against my prior-learning I’m tempted to go all in in order to learn something. Some that come to mind are…

- Committing to every person has a wearable and every person has a coach (1 coach to however many members can get quality attention)
- Committing to tracking being a fundamental part of the gym (this would raise fees). I’ve seen many gyms have cool equipment but charge extra
- Committing to a no-freely working out kinda of idea. Like you must have a coach. You don’t have to use them but it’s part of the sell.
- Committing to a space outside my garage as a first iteration lol

### **Stage 1:**

- Publishing any frameworks I currently have and teaching them to others
    - Training meant for my mom and dad wife and child and siblings
- Adherence and optimization of my personal health.
    - Paying attention to what my needs are on this journey
    - Testing more regularly
- Acquiring deeper knowledge of the body and training and all the things…maybe certifications in various training style. (These come to mind immediately)
    - General Personal Training
    - Anatomy and Physiology
    - Onnit certification
    - Physical Therapy

### **Stage 1 to Stage 2 transition**

- Building my own personal garage gym and or public reference point where I can start sharing what may be working with friends and community.

### **Stage 2**

- Regularly have people join me and start forming a consistent group/ideology at my garage gym or somewhere nearby
- Incorporate as much testing and feedback as possible
- Develop further publication and product
    - Protein?
    - Supplements?
    - Gold Standard Reference points of pre-existing ones? until we are able to make our own

### **Stage 3**

- Hopefully we can outgrow the garage space and make a leap to a bigger space.
- We have to start charging people here.
- This would be the first space outside of my garage
    - We should prioritize learning from running the business, nail all the small details, and focus on improving this process
        - Is this a great offering?
        - Are people referring without asking?
        - Am I personally happy with it?
    - Additionally we should start regularly publishing our own content to build awareness and dialogue around our ideas
- At this point we may need to foray into testing and building out systems for testing
    - at first I imagine we might offer it as an additional service purchased alla carte
        - We need to understand why members are purchasing this testing and why they aren’t… also part of this is having a strong why for testing and why each test is justified
            - IE VO2max is one of the greatest predictors of longevity we have atm [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRJ07Hy_KzE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRJ07Hy_KzE)
        - We would most likely do our best to partner with a third party lab at this point for things we can’t provide in house
        - I think we could at this point provide a wearable upon signup (potentially partner with a company like whoop, hopefully at a discount for our members)
- We could sell the products we champion made my third parties at this point having really clear and strong ethos behind each product.
    - Good protein source
    - Good supplements
    - Vevo Barefoot Shoes
    - Cookbooks
    - Home tracking equipment
    - Programs and resources etc
- This is also a good time to start beta testing a member profile technology (I think selling this software to other gyms could be a potential income stream as well)
    - The idea would be to potentially grab wearable data (apple health or whatever) partnered with your personal benchmarks/test members perform at the gym and tracking it over time. Very simple. Just lots of data points compared over time and we can add notes on check-ins etc. Potentially log plan details considerations etc. Potentially even put power in users hands to track workouts etc.
- Community outreach and gym level community engagement

### **Stage 4**

- We increase size of the gym by scaling up members. We fully launch whatever concept we’ve been working on. Increase pricing. offer more. Get more testing. Provide more scholarship. Incorporate more testing into our plans. And more actionable feedback based off testing
- As supplements prove out we build launch our own in order to drive down costs and offer full traceability starting with most achievable product probably protein.
- We start trying to bring a lab closer and closer to in-house depending on the user need/interest.
- We build out further testing infrastructure (sonogram, etc.) depending on the user need/interest
- We start playing with the idea of expanding the offering
    - Kitchen
    - Coffee Shop
    - Library
    - Garden
    - Etc

### **Blue Sky**

- It’s not clear or important how we get from stage 4 to blue sky for now but blue sky includes the following
    - Max amenties
    - Max testing translating to plans
    - Garden
    - Cafeteria
    - Best equipment
    - Library
    - Lab for testing and studies and publishing
    - Most if not every station has camera footage and bar tracking capabilities measuring your workout and tracking it against your personalized plan. Maybe this is maintained in an app
    - Classes
    - Orange theory style fitness
    - Yoga, Pilates, Physical therapy etc
    - Scholarships to the gym etc?
    - Company benefits/memberships to gym
    - Meditation Rooms

**Back to goal.**

> *Giving people the resources and knowledge to live the longest happiest healthiest life they can. The core of this idea is in imparting a framework of being a student to our own bodies, discovering, testing,  learning from, and improving upon which we know.*

Some unorganized errand thoughts I had…

- All of these resources in one place has the potential to overwhelm people. To solve around this we may opt to
    - Have an intro program that ramps up for all members
    - Baseline in then put members in a respective level similar to a mma gym
- It BLOWS MY MIND that equinox gets away with charging > $300 a month. surely we can provide much better service for at or around this
- I hate to be so money focused however I think we will need to make incredible margins for a plan to offer free memberships to disproportionately impact people. An essential question to answer is how might we do more outreach with less impact to bottom line.
    - Early thoughts are…
        - Similar to NFL play60 — some sort of community outreach initiative along those lines.
        - Free resources
        - Free content etc
