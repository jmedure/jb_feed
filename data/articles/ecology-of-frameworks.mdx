I learn frameworks and tools not to the end of being immediately useful, but to add to an arsenal of interconnected frameworks that help me respond to a given scenario the best way I can.

Ex:

I've journaled for several years. I've explored templated responses, 5 min and grattitude journaling, digital and physical vectors, etc. If the goal is to habitually interface with myself, all of these methods help me achieve this goal. They're are all useful, and not mutually exclusive. Right now, I'm gravitating towards the need for templated responses. I use Notion to generate them. This is stark to the last year I spent physically journaling free-form.

The point is that I strive to develop all of these methods for journaling so that I have the best tool to accomodate my ever fluid needs. I'm at a point where I need notion and some questions to journal effectively. This need is ephemeral. Which method will I use next?

The idea that I sharpen methods and frameworks to support a dynamic response to my needs is comprehensive but not rushed. I'm never trying to understand more than one method at a time. I trust myself to follow my curiosity. My understanding of a new framework is usually the result of having explored my curiosity or solving a unique need.

Once I've found something that's working, it gets added to my ecology of frameworks, to be brandished at a latter, undetermined date. It's important that there is often some re-learning involved, that closely couples with the idea of [life happening in seasons](https://jacobs.blue/journal/life-in-seasons).
